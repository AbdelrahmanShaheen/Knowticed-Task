                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            If you are a knowticed user located in the United States or Canada, the "special arbitration provision for United States or Canada users" section below applies to you.
                            Please also read that section carefully and completely. If you are not subject to the "special arbitration provision for United States or Canada users” section below, 
                            you agree that any claim or cause of action you have against knowticed relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with our terms or our services, and for
                            any claim or cause of action that knowticed files against you, you and knowticed agree that any such claim or cause of action (each, a "dispute," and together, "disputes") 
                            will be resolved exclusively in the United States district court for the northern district of California or a state court located in San Mateo County in California, and you 
                            agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts to litigate any such claim or cause of action, and the laws of the state of California will govern any such claim
                            or cause of action without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in our sole discretion, we may elect to resolve any dispute
                            we have with you that is not subject to arbitration in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the dispute.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The laws of the state of California govern our terms, as well as any disputes, whether in court or arbitration, which might arise between knowticed and you, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            These terms also limit the time you have to bring a claim or dispute, including the time to start arbitration or, if permissible,
                            a court action or small claims proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. We and you agree that for any
                            dispute (except for the excluded disputes defined below) we and you must bring claims including commencing an arbitration proceeding within one month after the dispute 
                            first arose; otherwise, such dispute is permanently barred. 
                            This means that if we or you do not bring a claim (including commencing an arbitration) within one month after the dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late. See below: special arbitration provision for United States or Canada users.

                    <p>
                        Please read this section carefully because it contains additional provisions applicable only to our United States and Canada users. If you are a knowticed user located in the United States or Canada, you and we agree to submit all disputes to binding individual arbitration, except for those that involve intellectual property disputes and except those that can be brought in small claims court. This means you waive
                        your right to have such disputes resolved in court by a judge or jury. Finally, you may bring a claim only on your behalf, and not on behalf of any official or other person, or class of people. You waive your right to participate in or have your dispute heard and resolved as, a class action, a class arbitration, or a representative action.

                    <p>
                        "excluded dispute" means any dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents) or efforts to interfere with our services or engage with our services in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). For clarity and
                        notwithstanding the foregoing, those disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not excluded disputes.

                        Federal arbitration act: The United States federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this "special arbitration provision for United States or Canada users" section, including any question whether a dispute between knowticed and you are subject to arbitration.

                    <p>
                        Agreement to arbitrate for knowticed users located in the United States or Canada: for knowticed users who live in the United States or Canada, knowticed and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all disputes, except for the excluded disputes. Knowticed and you agree that all disputes (except for the excluded disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. Knowticed and you agree not to combine a dispute that is subject to arbitration under our terms with a dispute that is
                        not eligible for arbitration under our terms. Before you commence arbitration of a dispute, you must provide us with a written notice of dispute that includes your (a) name; (b) residence address; (c) username; (d) email address or phone number you use for your knowticed account; (e) a detailed description of the dispute; and (f) the relief you seek. Any notice of dispute you send to us should be emailed to <a href="mailto: support@knowticed.com">support@knowticed.com</a>. Before we commence an arbitration, we will send you a notice of the dispute to the email address you provide, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within sixty (90) days after the notice of dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its commercial arbitration rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the optional rules for emergency measures of
                        protection and the supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes (together, the "AAA rules"). The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA rules. The AAA rules,
